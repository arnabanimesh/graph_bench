## Getting started:
1. Run `download_data.py` to download the datasets.
2. Run `bench.py` to run benchmarks

### Criteria used for choosing graph analysis libraries:
1. Has to work across Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
2. Is maintained and updated.
3. Has the ability to show the names of the nodes in the path of the shortest length.

> Tried to achieve apples to apples comparison across libraries by using A* algorithm and no heuristics.
